# k8s-workshop

The purpose of this kubernetes workshop is to take you step by step through most of the common workloads cases and config.

It’s aimed at deepening the developer understanding of all core components glueing the application together.

Kubernetes is an abstraction layer , it runs on your local machine exactly as it runs on the cloud.

It’s purley hands-on with no concepts explained. https://kubernetes.io/  should be your best friend.

Some steps are done with a couple of different approaches , just to highlight the possibilities and deepen your understanding of the system. 

Please feel free to open issues with questions and requests.
